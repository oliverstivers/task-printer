      <h1>CSE 333 25au Exercise 6</h1>

<p>
<b>out:</b> Monday, October 6, 2025<br>
 <b>due:</b> Wednesday, October 8, 2025 by <b>10:00 am</b>,
 <b>No late exercises accepted</b>.
</p>


<p><b>Goals: </b>Learn how to use various parts of the standard C file I/O
library, particularly ones that will be needed on later projects.  Also reenforce
understanding of exactly what is in a file that is stored on the disk.</p>

  <p><b>Description: </b>
     Write a C program that accepts a filename as a single
     command-line argument.  The program should read the file,
     copying the contents of the file to <code>stdout</code> in reverse order, character
     by character (or, more precisely, byte by byte).
     </p>

     <p>
     For example, consider a file name <code>foo.txt</code> in the
     current directory that contains the
     following 7 bytes (the 7th byte is the newline character at the end):
     <blockquote><pre>hello!
</pre></blockquote>
     Running the program should result in the following:
     <blockquote><pre>
<b>bash$</b> ./ex6 foo.txt

!olleh<b>bash$</b></pre></blockquote>
     Pay careful attention to where the newline and other characters
     are in this output.<br>
     </p>

	<p>You will need to use several standard library calls in order to
       do this.  In particular, you should use:
       <ul>
         <li> <code>fopen</code>, with mode "rb", to open the file</li>
         <li> <code>fclose</code> to close the file</li>
         <li> <code>fseek</code> and <code>ftell</code> to figure out
           how large the file is.  (We'd suggest you
           <code>fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);</code> and then <code>size =
             ftell(f);</code> to get the file size, in bytes.)</li>
         <li> <code>fseek</code> and <code>fread</code> to read the
           file's contents, in reverse order, byte-by-byte.</li>
         <li> <code>printf</code>, with the <code>%c</code> format code, to print out the
           characters (bytes) of the file one at a time.</li>
       </ul>
       </p>

    <p>Your code should read the bytes one-at-a-time and print them
    immediately.  Do not read the entire file into memory and print it
    backwards or create a reversed copy of the data and print that. A goal
    of this exercise is to gain experience with the various file I/O
    functions described above.</p>

	<p>Remember to consult the
       <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/">C/C++ Reference Material</a>
       and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html">Linux manual pages</a>
       to learn how to use each of these functions. (Check
       out the <code>stdio.h</code> header)</p>

	<p>Note: Some of these library functions are quite old and have parameters or results
	whose type is <code>long</code>.  Style guides and programs like
	<code>cpplint</code> generally discourage using <code>long</code>
	and recommend using types like <code>int64_t</code> instead.
	But for these library functions it's appropriate
	to use variables of type <code>long</code> to match function
	parameter and result types, since that guarantees an exact match
	regardless of the exact size of <code>long</code> on the underlying
	machine.  Feel free to ignore any <code>cpplint</code>
	warnings about using <code>long</code> in these situations.</p>

	<p>Hint: you can use linux commands like <code>hexdump -C foo.txt</code> or
	<code>hexdump -c foo.txt</code> to look at the bytes in a file <code>foo.txt</code>
	in hex and in other formats
	to see exactly what's there, including invisible characters.
	Many text editors also have modes to do this.</p>

  <p>

  <hr>
  <p>Your code must:
  <ul>
    <li> compile without errors or warnings on CSE Linux machines
	(lab workstations, attu, or CSE home VM)</li>

    <li> have no crashes, memory leaks, or memory errors on CSE linux machines
    (Suggestion: <code>valgrind</code>)</li>

    <li> be contained in a single file called <code>ex6.c</code>
    that compiles with the command <code>gcc -Wall -g -std=c17 -o ex6 ex6.c</code> -- do
    not submit a Makefile.</li>

    <li> be pretty: the formatting, modularization, variable and
    function names, and so on must make us smile rather than cry.
    (Suggestion: <code>cpplint --clint</code>)
	</li>

    <li> be robust: you should think about handling bogus input
    from the user (if any), and you should handle hard-to-handle cases
    (if there are any) gracefully.</li>

    <li> have a comment at the top of the source file with your name,
    and CSE or UW email address.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

  <p>
  You should submit your exercise using the Gradescope dropbox linked on the
course resources web page.</p>
