      <h1>CSE 333 25au Exercise 3</h1>

<p>
<b>out:</b> Wednesday, October 1, 2025<br>
 <b>due:</b> Friday, October 3, 2025 by <b>10:00 am</b>,
 <b>No late exercises accepted.</b>
</p>
<p><b>Goals: </b>Write a program that uses structs, typedef,
and dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free).</p>

   <p><b>Description: </b>Your job is to write a C program that does the following:

     <ul>
       <li> uses typedef to define a new structured type called
       <code>Point3d</code>, which contains <code>uint16_t</code> fields for x, y, and z
       coordinates. </li>

       <li> defines a function called <code>AllocatePoint3d</code> that accepts
       three <code>uint16_t</code> values as arguments, mallocs space for a <code>Point3d</code>, assigns
       those three arguments to the x, y, and z fields, and returns (a
       pointer to) the malloc'ed <code>Point3d</code>.
       </li>
       
       <li> has a main() that "tests" <code>Allocate<code>Point3d</code></code>.  
       For the purposes of this exercise, it is enough for you to write
       code that simply allocates a struct by calling Allocate<code>Point3d</code>
       and verifies that the struct
       members contain the correct values.
       Your "test" should print an appropriate message if something is wrong;
       if all is well your program should terminate silently.
       Make sure your
       main function frees any memory that <code>Allocate<code>Point3d</code></code> allocates.
       <strong>Hint:</strong> Don't make assumptions about what 
       <code>Allocate<code>Point3d</code></code> does, even though you implement it.
       Imagine that your <code>main</code> is testing  an implementation of
       <code>Allocate<code>Point3d</code></code> that is implemented by another programmer.
       </li>

     </ul>

     Note:  we will be using valgrind to test whether your code has a
     memory leak! (You probably should too...)
  <p>
  <hr>
  <p>
  
<p>Your code must:
  <ul>
    <li>compile without errors or warnings on CSE Linux machines
         (lab workstations, attu, or CSE home VM)</li>
    
    <li>have no crashes, memory leaks, or memory errors on CSE linux machines</li>
    
    <li>be contained in a single file called <code>ex3.c</code>
    that compiles with the command <code>gcc -Wall -g -std=c17 -o ex3 ex3.c</code> --
    do not submit a Makefile.  </li>
    
    <li>be pretty: the formatting, modularization, variable and
    function names, and so on must make us smile rather than cry.
    <!-- still no clint yet
    (suggestion: check your code with <code>clint</code>.)</li>
    -->

    <li>be robust: you should think about handling bogus input
    from the user (if any), and you should handle hard-to-handle cases
    (if there are any) gracefully.</li>

    <li>have a comment at the top of your <code>.c</code> file with your name,
    and CSE or UW email address.</li>
  </ul>
  </p> 

  <p>
  You should submit your exercise using the Gradescope dropbox linked on the
course resources web page.</p>
