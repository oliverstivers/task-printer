  CSE 333 Exercise Rating Scale
</div>
<div class="staff-blurb-content">
  <p>
	Each exercise this quarter is rated on a integer scale of 1 &ndash; 5,
	inclusive, with 1 being the "least time-consuming" and 5 being the "most
	time-consuming".
  </p>

  <p>
    This difficulty scale is meant as a rough guide for you in predicting the
	amount of time to set aside for each exercise as you balance the work
	required for 333 with your other obligations.
	However, it is necessarily imperfect as everyone's set of circumstances and
	experiences with the exercises differ.
	If your experience with an exercise does not align with its rating, that is
	not a reflection of you or your abilities.

          One way to estimate &#x03C0; is to use the following infinite series,
            which was discovered by Nilakantha in the 15th century:
        </p>
<pre>
&#x03C0; = 3 + (4 / (2 x 3 x 4)) - (4 / (4 x 5 x 6)) + (4 / (6 x 7 x 8)) - ...
</pre>
        <p>
          Breaking the series down:
        </p>
          <ul>
          <li>The zero'th term in the series is: <tt>3</tt></li>
          <li>The first term in the series is: <tt>+(4 / (2 x 3 x 4))</tt></li>
          <li>The second term in the series is: <tt>-(4 / (4 x 5 x 6))</tt></li>
          <li>The n'th term in the series is: <tt>(-1)<sup>(n+1)</sup> &middot; (4 / (2n &middot; (2n+1) &middot; (2n+2)))</tt></li>

  <h4>Libraries</h4>
  <p>
    As part of this exercise you will need to explore some of the basic C
    libraries in order to convert the command-line argument (the string of
    digit characters) to an <code>int</code> value and print the result.
    The nav bar above links you to <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference">
    www.cplusplus.com/reference</a> as the "C/C++ Reference", which contains
    information about the C and C++ libraries (ignore the C++ info for now).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In particular, you will find it useful to look at (1) the <code>stdio.h</code>
      library for basic input and output, (2) <code>string.h</code> for handling
      C-strings (<em>i.e.</em>, null-terminated arrays of characters), and (3)
      <code>stdlib.h</code> for some useful functions.</li>
    <li>There are multiple ways to parse (convert) strings of digit characters
      to integer values, including <code>sscanf</code>, <code>atoi</code>, and
      others; think about the tradeoffs and differences between them.</li>
    <li>You are allowed to use any standard library function that does not
      require additional compilation options (see Submission details
      <a href="#submit">below</a>).
      In particular, you may not use functions from the <code>math.h</code>
      library.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>User Input</h4>
  <p>
    You should handle various inputs from the user, which may be in an
    unexpected format.
    For each input, you should take some time to reason through your options
    for handling it gracefully (<em>i.e.</em>, without unexpectedly crashing),
    decide which one seems "best", and document your decision in your code.
    Note that you do not need to give a fully detailed explanation; short
    well-written comments are fine.
    Example unexpected inputs for this exercise include, but are not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><pre>$ <b>./ex0</b></pre></li>
    <li><pre>$ <b>./ex0 hello</b></pre></li>
    <li><pre>$ <b>./ex0 0.05432</b></pre></li>
    <li><pre>$ <b>./ex0 10000000 3234</b></pre></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For simplicity, one case you can ignore is when someone inputs an integer
    that is too large to fit into an <code>int</code> data type
    (<em>e.g.</em>, 2<sup>351</sup> is too big to fit into 32 bits).
  </p>

  <h4>Arithmetic</h4>
  <p>
    To avoid floating-point arithmetic errors, please make sure your code
    adheres to the following rules:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use C's <code>double</code> type for intermediate and final results.</li>
    <li>Sum the series in order from term 0 to term n (and not the other way around).</li>
  </ol>

      <div class="panel-body">

        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>
          As a starting point, get comfortable with the C best practices
          mentioned in the first lecture, particularly focusing on <b>program
          layout</b> and <b>function ordering</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other style issues to keep in mind, even though not discussed in
          lecture, include: indenting your code consistently, factoring out
          code into helper functions when appropriate, and writing an adequate
          amount of useful comments.
        </p>

        <h4>User Input</h4>
        <p>
          You will also be expected to be <b>robust in handling user input</b>,
          which includes handling unexpected inputs.
          Refer to <a href=#impl_notes>the section above</a> for more details.
        </p>

        <h4>Tools</h4>
        <p>
          <span class="red-text">Make sure that you run the linter
          (<code>./cpplint.py --clint ex0.c</code>) and valgrind
          (<code>valgrind ./ex0 &lt;input&gt;</code>) on your code and resolve
          any indicated issues before submitting.</span>
          <ul>
            <li>See the
              <a href="../cpplint.html#download"><button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-xs link-button"><img src="../site/img/icon_txt.png"/>cpplint page</button></a>

            <li><span class="red-text">For this exercise only:</span> you may
              ignore the error &quot;sscanf can be ok, but is slow and can
              overflow buffers&quot;.</li>
            <li>When you have fixed all linter errors, you should see the
              following output from <code>clint.py</code>:
<pre>$ <b>./cpplint.py --clint ex0.c</b>
Done processing ex0.c
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>For <em>each</em> choice of <tt>&lt;input&gt;</tt>, you should
              be looking to see the following line of output from
              <code>valgrind</code>:
<pre>
$ <b>valgrind ./ex0 &lt;input&gt;</b>
...
ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

            <li>Have no runtime errors, memory leaks, or memory errors
              (<code>gcc</code> and <code>valgrind</code>).</li>
            <li>Be contained in the file listed above that compiles with the
              command:<br>

                <li><code>math.h</code> is disallowed because it won't work

              function names, commenting, and so on should be consistent with
              class style guidelines.
              Additionally, the linter shouldn't have any complaints about your
              code (<code>cpplint.py --clint</code>).</li>
            <li>Be robust: your code should deal with hard-to-handle/edge cases
              and bogus user input (if there are any) gracefully.</li>
